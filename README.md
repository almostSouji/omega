# A SIEM detection format for JavaScript objects.

The pattern matching and rule syntax are based on [Sigma rules](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma), but adapted for the analysis of javscript objects rather than logfiles.

# Roadmap

- [ ] Rule evaluation CI
- [ ] User test error handling for loading rules with invalid paths/weird user input
